                <p class="Inner-para">Dostoevsky's early years were spent in the hospital grounds where his father worked, 
                    exposing him to the harsh realities of life, including the suffering of the poor and sick. This experience 
                    left a lasting impression on him and influenced the themes of social inequality and human suffering in his 
                    later works.</p>

                <p class="Inner-para">
                    In 1834, at the age of 12, Dostoevsky was sent to a private boarding school in Moscow. Three years later, 
                    he and his brother Mikhail were enrolled in the Military Engineering Academy in St. Petersburg. Although 
                    Dostoevsky showed little interest in military engineering, this period allowed him to develop his love for 
                    literature. He read extensively, becoming particularly influenced by the works of Homer, Shakespeare, and 
                    Gothic fiction.

                <p class="Inner-para">
                    Fyodor Dostoevsky's turn towards philosophical writing was deeply influenced by his personal tragedies and 
                    hardships, such as the early death of his parents and his own near-execution and exile to Siberia. These 
                    experiences exposed him to the darker aspects of human existence, prompting him to explore existential and moral 
                    questions in his work. His time in prison and interactions with fellow inmates enriched his understanding of human 
                    psychology, leading to a profound examination of themes like free will, faith, and redemption in his literary works.

                <p class="Inner-para">
                    Additionally, Dostoevsky was influenced by the intellectual and socio-political currents of his time. He engaged 
                    with the ideas of Western philosophers and Russian intellectuals, integrating their debates into his narratives. 
                    The socio-political upheaval in Russia, including the rise of radical ideologies and the plight of the oppressed, 
                    further fueled his critique of utopian socialism, rationalism, and modernity. This confluence of personal 
                    experience and intellectual engagement made Dostoevsky’s writings deeply philosophical, addressing the moral and 
                    spiritual dimensions of contemporary issues.

                            "Crime and Punishment" is one of Dostoevsky's most famous novels. It tells the story of Raskolnikov, 
                            a former student who commits a murder and grapples with intense guilt and moral dilemmas. The novel
                            explores themes of redemption, morality, and the psychological impact of crime.

                            "The Brothers Karamazov" is one of Dostoevsky's most renowned novels. It follows the turbulent 
                            relationships within the Karamazov family—father Fyodor Pavlovich and his three sons, Dmitri, Ivan, 
                            and Alyosha. The novel explores deep themes such as faith, doubt, and morality, examining how these 
                            issues affect each character's life and choices. Through their personal struggles, the book delves 
                            into philosophical questions about good, evil, and redemption.

                            This novella is a cornerstone of existential literature. It presents a deeply introspective monologue 
                            by an unnamed narrator, known as the Underground Man, who rejects society and explores themes of 
                            alienation, free will, and the irrational aspects of human nature.
